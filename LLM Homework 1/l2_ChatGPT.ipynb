# Guidelines for Prompting
In this lesson, you'll practice two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models.

## Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.

### 📝 Markdown Cell 6

#### helper function
Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat).

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs.  
**Note**: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.

---

### 🔹 Code Cell 7 [Execution: 5]

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

---

### 📝 Markdown Cell 8

**Note:** This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version `0.27.0`.

In order to use the OpenAI library version `1.0.0`, here is the code that you would use instead for the `get_completion` function:

```python
client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### 📝 Markdown Cell 9

## Prompting Principles
- **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
- **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

### Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`

---

### 🔹 Code Cell 10 [Execution: 6]

```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \
providing instructions that are as clear and \
specific as you can possibly make them. \
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \
and context for the model, which can lead to \
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Output:**
```
It is important to provide clear and specific instructions to guide a model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses, even if it means writing a longer prompt for more clarity and context.
```

---

### 📝 Markdown Cell 11

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
- JSON, HTML

---

### 🔹 Code Cell 12 [Execution: 7]

```python
prompt = f"""

with their authors and genres.
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys:

```

**Output:**

foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations \
as a function of the number of square feet.
```
Student's solution:
```
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
```
Actual solution:
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Output:**
```
The actual solution is correct.

Actual solution:
Total cost = Land cost + Solar panel cost + Maintenance cost
Total cost = $100x + $250x + $100,000 + $10x
Total cost = $360x + $100,000

Is the student's solution the same as actual solution just calculated:
```
yes
```

Student grade:
```
correct
```
```

#### Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom

To install the OpenAI Python library:
```
!pip install openai
```

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:
 ```
 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
 ```

Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
```

#### A note about the backslash
- In the course, we are using a backslash `\` to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
- GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not.  But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.
